      <h2>Anvil Hack III will take place April 22 - 23 2017, with tickets available soon.</h2>
      <p>Anvil Hack - the student-run hackathon at Goldsmiths, Unviersity of London - is back for the third year! Our hackathon is focussed on the creative applications of technology taking place at a centre of creative computing research.</p>
      <p>Use your skills to make something wonderful, arty, musical - anything you build will be awesome. We'll provide you with food, drink, electricity and internet, so that you can get on with the real work - making cool things!</p>
      <p>This year we have the privilege of sharing our brand new fabrication lab with you, built right into the church. You'll have access to state of the art equipment just a couple of months after it's been installed. Exciting!</p>
